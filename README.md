# Ric's Hotel
## Final homework of week 2

This is a booking system (almost) for hotels that manages bookings, revenue, occupancy rate, etc.

It is not finished as it requires more features, but I was starting to have dreams about this homework... never stopped thinking about it, so I decided I was just going to make all the tests pass and be done with it for now. Was driving me insane. haha
