# Ric's Hotel
## Final homework of week 2

This is a booking system in ruby (almost) for hotels that manages bookings, revenue, occupancy rate, etc.

It is not finished as it requires more features, but I was starting to have dreams about this homework... never stopped thinking about it, so I decided I was just going to make all the tests pass and be done with it for now. Was driving me insane. haha


It's lacking:
* A CLI front-end
* Use dates for the bookings
* Keeping track of the money
* Kick guests from the hotel
* Maybe a restaurant for the hungry :)

###### Total time dedicated: 12h

Goodbye for now.
